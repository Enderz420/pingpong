1. Enter the password you've been provided at the bottom of the page, then press enter
2. Choose the player you want to change by entering a number (1 for player1, 2 for player2 etc.)
3. Write the name of the player
4. Press "Make player"
5. Your player should now show up in the area below. If it briefly shows up or doesn't show up at all, you've likely entered the password wrong

To add a point to a player, just press the number key corresponding to their ID, (1 for player1 etc)
